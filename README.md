# leaflet-challenge

## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Create the Earthquake Visualization

1. Dataset Acquisition:
   - Obtain earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, selecting a dataset of interest.
2. Data Import and Visualization:
   - Utilize Leaflet to create a map plotting all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
   - Customize data markers to reflect earthquake magnitude (size) and depth (color).
   - Include informative popups for each earthquake marker.
   - Create a legend to provide context for the map data.
